# Otter Coding & PyPassword Generator 🦦💻🔐

Welcome to the **Otter Coding** project! This repository is home to both a friendly coding otter mascot and a beginner-friendly **Python Password Generator** script. Dive in, have fun, and explore code in a relaxed, playful way.

## About This Project

This project combines:
- **Coding Otter Image**: A lighthearted visual to inspire you and remind you that coding can be fun and approachable.
- **PyPassword Generator**: A simple Python script that generates secure, customizable passwords based on user input.

### Password Generator

The **PyPassword Generator** script allows users to create passwords with a specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers. Great for beginner coders and anyone needing secure passwords on the fly!

### How to Use the Password Generator

1. **Run the Script**: 
   - Clone or download this repository.
   - Run `password_generator.py` using Python:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**: 
   - Enter the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you’d like in your password.
   - The script will output a randomized, secure password.

### Example

Here’s what the output looks like:

```bash
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
# [Enter number of letters]
How many symbols would you like?
# [Enter number of symbols]
How many numbers would you like?
# [Enter number of numbers]

Your password is: x2@!aB9%v
```
